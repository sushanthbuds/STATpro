### Problem Statement

You are required to discover a visualization from the web or another source and create several redesigns for the original visualization. This process should help you identify unique patterns or information that were not initially evident.

Additionally, you are expected to compare and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of both the original plot and your redesigns, considering the context.

The redesign project includes, updating your website with the redesigned project, accompanied by a 10 minute oral video presentation embedded on your website.

### Bad Graph

A bad graph is a graph that misrepresents or distorts the data, making it difficult for viewers to understand or draw accurate conclusions. It may include cluttered visuals, misleading scales, or inappropriate chart types that obscure the message. Bad graphs lead to confusion rather than clarity in the interpretation of the data.

### Good Graph

A good graph represents the data clearly and accurately which makes it easier for viewers to understand the key insights briefly. It uses appropriate chart types, clean labels, and proper scales to avoid confusion. A well-designed graph enhances the clarity and effectiveness of the data it presents.
