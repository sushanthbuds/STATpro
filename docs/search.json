    "text": "Bad Graph\nIncome comparison between Men and Women\nThe above graph is a radial bar chart showing the median annual earnings of men and women, categorised by industry, for civilian employed population aged 16 years and above in the U.S. The chart compares income ranges in which different color depths of blue and red denote greater than $80K and less than $20K, respectively. Each industry forms a sector around the circle and gender wise bar for men and women to have the overview of gender wage differential for each industry.\nAnalysis of the bad graph:\nValues are Hard to Compare : It becomes virtually impossible to attempt any sort of comparison of income disparities across different industries when some of categories are located quite a distance away from others around the circumference of the circle in radial form.\nInefficient Use of Space and Labeling : The circular design bends the bar lengths and since the values are in income, the figures are almost challenging to classify nearer to the center.\nColor and Accessibility Issues : The blue for man and the red for woman barely differs and this feature makes it relatively difficult to be understood, particularly by individuals with color vision deficiency."

    "text": "Interactive Bar Chart (Redesigned Visual 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the chart\n\n⁠Comparison of Men and Women’s Income by Industry : The bar chart represents the contrast between men income; generally, labeled as Mincome and women income; generally labeled as Fincome, by industries that include agriculture, construction, education, finance, healthcare, information technology, manufacturing, and retail trade.\nBar Representation : Each industry has two bars; the dark blue bar to indicate the Median men’s income and the lighter blue bar to indicate Median women’s income. This also ensures that there are two important documents: one to compare with the other.\nInteractivity : The income magnitude for each industry is represented, and viewers can obtain more specific values in the form of just a number by hovering the pointer over each fragment displayed on the chart.\n\n⁠⁠4. Disparity Highlight : A neatly contrasting bar graph underlines the kind of industries that feature a large disparity in income, such as Finance wherein male earnings tower over the women employees.\nBenefits of the redesigned interactive bar chart:\n\nImproved Comparability : The baseline common to both male and female incomes and the vertical bars appearing in the new chart assists in comparing accurate income differences between males and females in different industries than doing so in the circular chart because the angles cannot be accurate.\nEasier Interpretation : The modular structure and clearly labeled axes in the redesign also make it possible to track differences between males and females within each sector without much mental effort compared to their approach in the original design.\nReduced Visual Clutter : The new chart format dispenses with the mess of the circular plan, providing a precise point-by-point comparison, which occupies less space and makes patterns stand out.\nHighlighting Key Trends : The numerical arrangement in the redesign is unarguably aligned to sectors with widest gap in earnings, say for example, Finance & Construction industries; Huge gaps make it quicker to recognize clear trends."

It uses solid and dashed lines to distinguish between the income of men and women.\nAbout the visual\n\nIndustry-wise Comparison:\n\n\nEach panel represents a different industry (Education, Finance, Healthcare, Retail, and Technology), showing income trends for both men and women within the same plot.\nThere is a noticeable disparity between men’s and women’s income in all industries, with men consistently earning more across the years.\n\n\nIncome Trends:\n\n\nThe graph highlights a steady increase in income for both genders across most industries from 2015 to 2019.\nThe gap between men’s and women’s income persists, especially in industries like Finance and Technology, where men’s income shows more significant growth compared to women’s income.\n\n\nColor and Line Representation:\n\n\nThe solid green line represents the trend in men’s income, while the solid maroon line represents the trend in women’s income. These colors help distinguish the two genders clearly in each plot.\nThe lines for both genders are parallel in some industries, indicating consistent disparities over time, whereas in other industries, such as Technology, the gap appears to widen."

For example, men in Technology seem to have a high satisfaction level of around 85, while women in Manufacturing have a lower satisfaction level of around 60.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nThe graph reveals that in certain occupations (such as Technology and Finance), both men and women report higher job satisfaction, with higher incomes indicated by larger bubble sizes.\nIn contrast, Manufacturing shows lower satisfaction levels for both men and women, with smaller bubbles representing lower income levels.\n\nDual Information Display:\n\nThis bubble chart effectively conveys both job satisfaction and income levels in one visual, allowing for the examination of trends in both satisfaction and compensation across genders and industries."

This process should help you identify unique patterns or information that were not initially evident.\nAdditionally, you are expected to compare and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of both the original plot and your redesigns, considering the context.\nThe redesign project includes, updating your website with the redesigned project, accompanied by a 10 minute oral video presentation embedded on your website.\n\n\nBad Graph\nA bad graph is a graph that misrepresents or distorts the data, making it difficult for viewers to understand or draw accurate conclusions. It may include cluttered visuals, misleading scales, or inappropriate chart types that obscure the message. Bad graphs lead to confusion rather than clarity in the interpretation of the data.\n\n\nGood Graph\nA good graph represents the data clearly and accurately which makes it easier for viewers to understand the key insights briefly. It uses appropriate chart types, clean labels, and proper scales to avoid confusion. A well-designed graph enhances the clarity and effectiveness of the data it presents."
